Code and data for "Identifying Important Identities" article.

# Abstract

Academic researchers across social science disciplines are increasingly focused on identity as both an explanatory as well as an outcome variable. I argue that there are limitations to previous work on identity in that scholars are often hyper-focused on only one type of identity (i.e. demographics) and are often limited in their definitions of the term (i.e. academic ones). To address this gap, I present the results of an original open-ended survey that directly asked ordinary Americans what identities are most important to them for themselves and in their relationships. I find that people most frequently list positive characteristics such as honesty, friendliness, and loyalty. While the results of the content analysis showed personality, behaviors, and traits to be the most common category, it also showed that there were a wide variety of identities that people listed with varying frequency. Respondents were more likely to share identities with close ties (family and friends) than weaker ties (acquaintances) and less so with people they dislike.  These results should be of interest to scholars across social science disciplines interested in identity and can be used to inform the design of future studies.
